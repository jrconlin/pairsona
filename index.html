<h1>QR based push message linkup proof of concept</h1>
<p>The following proof of concept connects two user agents using a QR code.</p>
<p>Due to some restrictions, this must be served off of a TLS site, however
all encryption, message sending and other functions are done in good ol' plain 
javascript. (please do not judge me on how bad it is, it's a proof of concept.)</p>
<h2>To Begin</h2>
<ol>
<li>Start <a href="https://evilonastick.com/qrdinate/alice/">Alice's page</a> on any firefox (android included)</li>
<li>Then connect using <a href="https://evilonastick.com/qrdinate/bob/">Bob's page</a> using any firefox &lt; 62. (The capture library does not work on 62)</li>
</ol>
<p>The UAs should connect, &amp; exchange some push messages.</p>
